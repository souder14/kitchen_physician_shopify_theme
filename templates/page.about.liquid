      <h1 class="kp-h1">The Kitchen Physician story.</h1>
      <p class="kp-body-lg">
        At The Kitchen Physician, we believe true wellness starts with nature.
        Rooted in Ward 8 yet serving the entire city and beyond, we craft handmade herbal products,
        fresh juices, and wholesome meals that honor both tradition and innovation.
      </p>
      <p class="kp-body-lg">
        More than a business, we’re a movement — employing local residents, empowering youth,
        and keeping remedies affordable and accessible so that every neighbor can experience
        mind–body–spirit wellness.
